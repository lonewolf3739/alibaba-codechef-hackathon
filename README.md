## Getting Started

App built using Codechef API, Alibaba Cloud resourses and some dedication

### Prerequisites

Before running the application we need to have these installed

```
python3.5 +
python3-pip 
pymongo 
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Install pip
```
apt-get install python3-pip
```
Install pymongo
```
apt-get install python-pymongo
```
install dependencies
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```

In case if you get error running the app we need to modify flask_oauth.py as mentiond in 
presentation

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

```
python3 app.py
```
